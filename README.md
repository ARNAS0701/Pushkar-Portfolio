# Pushkar-Portfolio
I had made this portfolio website for a friend of mine named "Pushkar singh" back in 9th Grade. I would urge you people to have a look. It's not all vanilla. I have made use of a lot of tailblocks provided by tailwind css along with some css, js, & html from my own side. 
Make sure to star the repository in case you like it.
